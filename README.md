## What is this?
The repository contains all project code used by Vincent van der Eijk and Erik Lamers
for a research project organised by the University of Amsterdam Security and Network Engineering master.

Our project consists of looking for port based security differences between dual stack hosts.
This is achieved by scanning the public internet for dual stack host based on existing datasets.

## Why is this necessary?
"Don't Forget to Lock the Back Door! A Characterization of IPv6 Network Security Policy" Czyz et. al. (2016).
Already showed us that there is a major difference between IPv4 and IPv6 port based security policies.
We are now 2 years later and IPv6 adoption is growing. So it's important to see what is the current status quo.

Also we are planning to inform all system administrators with a difference in security policies automatically, 
based on WHOIS information.
